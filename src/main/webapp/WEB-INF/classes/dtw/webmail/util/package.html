Provides utility classes for jwma.

<p>
It contains a class for loading Properties in a convenient way, and
the class that implements more or less flexible logging for jwma.
It also contains the classes that handle <tt>multipart/form-data</tt> uploads,
by utilizing the existant Mime handling functionality in JavaMail.
A general working version of such classes, which allows access to binary data in form of files,
 could be easily derived from the existing versions.
